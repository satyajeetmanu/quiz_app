> Render content conditionally and lifting state up:


> initState(): executes once after the object of the state has been created

> Every Flutter Widget has a built-in lifecycle: A collection of methods that are automatically executed 
    by Flutter (at certain points of time).

> There are three extremely important (stateful) widget lifecycle methods you should be aware of:

    1. initState(): Executed by Flutter when the StatefulWidget's State object is initialized

    2. build(): Executed by Flutter when the Widget is built for the first time AND after setState() was called

    3. dispose(): Executed by Flutter right before the Widget will be deleted (e.g., because it was displayed
         conditionally)

> .map((item){}) -> used to convert a list of certain type into a list of any different type. The anonymous 
    function will be called for each 'item' in the list.
> ...   -> this operator is used to 'spread' the list. Pulls the items out of the list and places them as comma 
    sparated values.
